[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) is a fascinating language, which I'm slowly starting to fall in love with. In the last year, I've started writing a lot more [STL C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library), but my experience has been primarily focused on [Unreal Engines own C++ flavor](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/programming-with-cplusplus-in-unreal-engine). I like it well enough that I want to check out some other C++ libraries like [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and [FLECS](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs).
