I have a long and fruitful relationship with modding. Back in the day, I used to write [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugins for Minecraft. Then I got poached to create marketplace content for [Minecraft Bedrock Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bedrock_Edition_exclusive_features), which is how I supported myself though university.

Post University, I've dabbled in various games, but really found my home writing [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) mods for [Sapiens](https://www.playsapiens.com/). My largest contribution here is the [Hammerstone Modding Framework](https://github.com/Sapiens-OSS/hammerstone-framework), which has 10,000 installs.

Modding is enjoyable to me for a few reasons:
1) Building against an existing framework makes it easier for me to enjoy the content creation progress (I'm slow, so creating 1 mob is achievable, creating 200 is not).
2) "Breaking" games is fun. If you extend an existing game in a weird way, that's more interesting than building a similar game mechanic in a general purpose game engine.
3) Easier to find an audience (riding coattails).

If you want to join me in my modding adventures, I have a discord for [Sapiens](https://discord.gg/WnN8hj2Fyg) and [Minecraft](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN).
