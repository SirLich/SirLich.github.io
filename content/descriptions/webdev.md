Web development is a topic which I keep coming back to, despite not having the best relationship with it! I guess I just like publishing my stuff on the internet.

My most recent experience is with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (the framework this site is written in!), but in the past I've dabbled with [self-rolled SSGs](https://github.com/SirLich/pyml-mini), [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Angular](https://angular.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and of course plenty of hand-written HTML. Maybe [React](https://react.dev/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) next?
