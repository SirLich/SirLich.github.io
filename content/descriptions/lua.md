[Lua](https://www.lua.org/home.html) is a funky little language, which I've come to know through modding Sapiens. Here is a little hit-list of interesting features, in case you want to try Lua yourself:
 - Very small, very fast interpreted language, perfect for embedding
 - Good C/C++ FFI
 - Only one data type: The all powerful Table
 - Index starts at 1, not 0 (although that's a bit misleading)
 - The metaprogramming capabilities are a bit funky, but fairly powerful
