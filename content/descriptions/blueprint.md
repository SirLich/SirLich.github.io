[Blueprint](https://www.unrealengine.com/de/blog/introduction-to-blueprints) is a funky node-based programming language for use in [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US). Some say it's the best thing since sliced bread. Others... really hate it!

I fall somewhere in the middle. It's definitely an interesting tool, and I've seen it used to good effect. With that said, my professional experience has normally been on the other side of things: Writing performant and well organized systems in C++, that are then used within Blueprint. So while I consider myself very knowledgeable *about* Blueprint, I don't tend to use it day to day.
