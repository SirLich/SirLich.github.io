Here are my technology and language goals for 2024. You can find my [2023 reflections here](/blog/tech-goals-2023).

## Continue Using/Learning
 - Bevy (goal: Jam quality game)
 - Rust (goal: Finish project, or work related)
 - C++ (goal: Learn some STL, maybe complete some Leetcode problems)
 - Godot (content to make jam games)
   
## Stop Using
 - Perforce
 - Lua (within reason)
 
## Start Using/Learning
 - In person meetups 
 - Godot C#
 - Unreal Engine Verse 
 - Lisp

---

# Results

 - I quit my job as a VR developer, which mercifully freed me from Perforce!
 - I messed around with Bevy some more (still no games though)
 - At my new job, I've been writing many thousands of lines of pure C++ 17, with the STL.
 - I've joined the monthly gamedev meetup [in my area](https://www.games-bavaria.com/), and participated in-person at [Global Game Jam](https://sirlich.itch.io/funky-drive-through).
 - I stepped back from Sapiens modding to a large degree, so the quantity of Lua was more manageable

## Notably Missing
 - Lisp, Verse, and Godot C#

## Carry-over Goals from 2023
 - Wrote most of a Cascadia clone in Godot, using various techniques for the multiplayer aspect. Great learning project!
