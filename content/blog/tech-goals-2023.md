Inspired by [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/@bawad), here are my technology and language goals for 2023.

## Continue Using/Learning
 - Lua
   - LDoc/LuaDoc
   - LuaRocks
   - Language Review (MetaTables, all keywords, etc)
 - Godot
   - First Game 2023?
   - 4.x Multiplayer
   
## Stop Using
 - Golang
 - Python 'SSG' where JavaScript would suffice
 
## Start Using/Learning
 - JavaScript (modern language features, implementations)
 - Rust
 - Bevy
 - ECS Architecture (bevy?)
 - Fleet
 - VIM Extension for VSCode
 - VSCode Snippets
 - Lisp (or similar)
