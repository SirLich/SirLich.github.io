It is once again time to post a reflection on the technology I used in the past year, and state some goals for the coming year. You can find my [2025 reflections here](/blog/tech-goals-2025).

Last year, one of my goals was to re-focus my work-life balance, so that I would have more time for personal projects. This worked out pretty well for me. Other than a well-deserved break at the end of the year, I was able to keep up my hobby projects without any large gaps.

# How did last year go? 

I think my Tech Goals for last year were a bit asperational. I sunk my teeth into some more serious Godot game projects -stuff that could conceivably be sold commercially. Those ended up taking the lions share of my hobby time, so I didn't have a strong reason to start projects in e.g., Raylib. 

I think for this year I shall keep my goals a bit more modest, and better aligned with what I'm actually working on day-to-day.

## Continue Using/Learning
 - In-person events! Tech is simply more fun together. In person game-jams, play-tests and conferences were a big part of 2025 for me, and I want the same in 2026!
 - ThreeJS. This was introduced to me by my employer, but I see value for it in my personal projects as well.
 - Minecraft! I was recently re-introduced to this domain, and the Javascript API they provide is proving pretty fun to mess around with.

## Stop Using
 - Github, VSCode, and other Microsoft products. *this one is actually a joke, but truthfully I don't enjoy the stranglehold they have on the ecosystem!
