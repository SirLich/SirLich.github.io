When I critique my own jam games, I often find that I've put too much effort into polish, and not enough effort into the foundational bones of the game. I think I'm afraid that if I take on a risky idea, that I won't be able to execute it to some arbitrary quality bar.

In many respects, our product is very polished for a jam game. We largely don't use assets*, and yet out game has:
- 5 music tracks
- 4 boss fights with unique art and animations
- A fully animated credit scene + mini cinematic
- SFX created by hand from scratch, without external assets

*This year, a small number of assets were reused. Everything was still created by our team, but some things were pulled out of old project. Namely: Some of the player character animations, and the skull which telegraphs attacks.*

Reaching this level of polish is rewarding, but I'm not sure it's the "point" of a jam game.
