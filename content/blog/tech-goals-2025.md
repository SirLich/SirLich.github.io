Just like every year, I'm once again publishing a list of tech-goals for 2025.

Last year was an interesting year for me, due to switching jobs, and the crunch associated with that. As you can see in my github profile, non-work contributions dropped off a cliff in about june. My meta-tech goal is to re focus my work time so I have energy left over for personal projects.

## Continue Using/Learning

 - More C++! I want to dig deeper into C++20 features, like [ranges](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges), and the new [templating capabilities](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints)
 - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
 - [Godot Multiplayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html)

## Stop Using
 - Unreal Engine [Blueprints](https://www.unrealengine.com/de/blog/introduction-to-blueprints) (within reason)
 - Most AI tooling
 - [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) (I want to explore ECS outside of Rust)

## Start Using/Learning

 - Non-bevy ECS (probably [Flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs)?)
 - Personal use of [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US), to augment my professional experience.
 - Shaders, in general
 - [Godot Server APIs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/performance/using_servers.html) (low level tests)
 - [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 - [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)
